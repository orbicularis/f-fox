Filename = userChrome.css

This is a .css file to increase the font size in the URL bar in FireFox.

In Linux, FireFox tends to default to a very small font size in the URL bar.

This css tweak solves the problem without using a plugin.

The font referenced is Overpass, but any font family will do.  10pt font is nice on 1920x1080 monitor.  Adjust less or more to taste.
